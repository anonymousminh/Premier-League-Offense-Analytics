# Data-Wrangling-Project

In this project, I used a dataset from Kaggle which is called "Premier League Standings 22 Seasons (2000-2022)" to analyze the offenses of Premier League teams for a decade. I am a big fan of soccer, I watched Premier League for a decade and I really enjoyed doing it. There are some cool visualizations for the stats that offered a better appearance to see how they played within 10 years.
